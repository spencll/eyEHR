| Tech Stack  | What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this project.                                                                                                             |         |

Front end: React 
Backend: Node/express 
Database: PostgreSQL


| Stack Focus | Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         |
60/40 frontend/backend. More interested in the front end functionality and friendly user interface. And aesthetics. 


| Type        | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         |
Website 

| Goal        | What goal will your project be designed to achieve?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         |
Electronic health record for storing/accessing patient information.


| Users       | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         |
Health care providers. However, will make a login route for patients for them to access only their own information. Need a very careful authorization/route protection process to prevent malicious access.


| Data        | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. |         |

Patient demographics and exam encounter results. Patient database API will be self created but be seeded by another API that generates fake people information. Exam encounters will then be pushed onto the patient profiles as they are generated by health care providers. 


# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
  
  Users (just for login and auth)
    -username/password/isHCP/firstname/lastname
    -ID would be doctor ID if isHCP (could add a separate doctor table if needed)
  Patients
    -firstname/lastname/DOB/phone number... (demographics will have same schema as the fake profile API https://randomuser.me/ to make seeding easier )
  Appointments
    -Datetime/doctor ID (FK to users)/patient ID (FK to patients)/status
  Exam encounters 
    -Datetime/doctor ID (FK to users)/patient ID (FK to patients)/results (big object with all test findings)/signed

- Sourcing your data
Fake profile API for seeding: https://randomuser.me/ 
Patient database: self created API, full CRUD

- Determining user flow(s)
  Register as health care provider with invitation code -> sign in as HCP -> see appointment schedule -> see patient info -> can create/submit exam encounter->sign exam encounter
  Register as patient -> sign in as patient -> see own patient information and exam encounters -> logout 

- Setting up the backend and database
  Auth/CRUD routes for patient information/exam encounters
  
- Setting up the frontend
  Framework: Vite
  Usual nav bar stuff/appointments/patient search bar/exam encounter

- What functionality will your app include?
  Login/Sign up/patient search/see particular exam encounter/submit exam findings to update records 

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name                   | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design Database schema      | Determine the models and database schema required for your project.                                           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/1) |
| Source Your Data            | Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/2) |
| User Flows                  | Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a user’s experience to be like as they navigate your site. | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/3) |
| Set up backend and database | Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.        | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/4) |
| Set up frontend             | Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.            | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/5) |
| User Authentication         | Fullstack feature - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user                                     | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/6) |

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Stretch Goal      |


Having a separate front end for creating appointments for patients (site for patients to make appointments, pt info added into database upon completion)
Calender displaying the appointments.
Statistical analysis (patient age pie chart, male vs female, etc)
